In this paper, a controller hardware-in-the-loop (CHIL) testing of a fuzzy logic (FL) based energy storage management (ESM) system of medium voltage DC (MVDC) power system of an all electric ship (AES) is presented. The incorporation of the pulsed load to the electric ship creates challenges for energy management on the shipboard power system. In order to facilitate the generators in meeting transient and steady power demand of the shipboard power system, a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) consisted of a high energy density storage (battery) and a high power density storage (supercapacitor) is used. With the aim of controlling the operations of the energy storages, an intelligent ESM system is designed based on FL control technique which provides instantaneous reference powers for charging and discharging of the energy storages. To show the performances of the ESM system, a MVDC shipboard power system with gas turbine based generators, modular multilevel converters (MMC), propulsion load, ship service loads, pulsed load, battery, supercapacitor, dual active bridge (DAB) converters is modeled in SimPowerSystems and digital real-time simulator (DRTS). Later the ESM system is implemented on field programmable gate array (FPGA) (Vertex 707) to perform CHIL based validation by comparing results for offline simulation with CHIL test results.
