In this paper a FL based ESM is tested and validated using CHIL experiment. The MVDC system is modeled and simulated in a a DRTS whereas the control was implemented on FPGA. The HESS consisted of a supercapacitor and a battery is used to support the generators in meeting transient and steady power demand. A FL based intelligent ESM system is designed to control the power transfer among the the MVDC system and the energy storages. The ESM system is implemented on Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA (OP7020). Another FPGA board (OP5607) is used to show the analog output signals. CHIL based experiment is performed and the results are captured on the scope. Eventually, the CHIL based test results and off-line results from SimPowerSystems are compared. The results show that the FL based ESM is capable of maintaining the operations of the energy storages and assisting the generators in maintaining the power quality of the MVDC system.
